The Breaking Stereotypes of the Elderly project aims to create positive representation of people over 65 through telling stories as a short film.

>Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been. —David Bowie

The purpose of this project is to challenge and dismantle common stereotypes associated with elderly individuals. These stereotypes often include misconceptions about their abilities, interests, and overall contributions to society. By raising awareness about the diversity and capabilities of people over sixty-five in the local community this project supplies a voice that represents their concerns and perspective, and advocates for creating diverse, positive, and realistic portrayals of the elderly within media. This project aims to promote a more accurate, respectful, and inclusive understanding of aging in the elderly population.

## MISSION STATEMENT

The Breaking Stereotypes of the Elderly (BSE) project is dedicated to challenging and breaking the stereotypes surrounding elderly Australians over the age of sixty-five by telling authentic, diverse, and empowering stories that celebrate the richness of their lives. This project will allow older people to represent themselves, rather than being portrayed by other age groups which may represent cultural biases. The aim is to shift the narrative from one of limitation to one of vibrancy, resilience, and continued growth. Through compelling storytelling, a short film will portray elderly individuals not as marginalised or forgotten members of society, but as dynamic, multifaceted people who continue to inspire, contribute, and lead in ways that defy conventional expectations. Our mission is to create a powerful, positive representation that fosters respect, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the value that older generations bring to our world.

**_Elderly Stereotypes_**

Given the phenomenon of Australia’s aging population, now is an important moment to acknowledge the potential our older locals have to contribute to the community. The project views this type of discrimination from a cultural perspective, rather than from any individual’s perspective and therefore is not searching for a scapegoat, but rather is about understanding why negative stereotypes become prevalent within our communities. I hope to challenge negative depictions by showing the world from an older person’s perspective and allowing all sides of any issue to be told and provide a clear picture of how stereotypes reduce their identity to a set of negative characteristics.

Some examples of stereotyping include:

* Elderly being portrayed as physically weak, dependent, or incapable of performing basic tasks without assistance, while in reality aging can bring physical challenges, many older people maintain a high level of physical fitness, participate in demanding activities, and live independently.
* While older adults can suffer from significant cognitive decline, such as memory loss, cognitive decline varies widely, and many elderly individuals remain sharp, continue to learn, adapt to new technologies, and engage in intellectually challenging activities.
* The elderly have been depicted as stuck in their ways, resistant to new ideas, or unwilling to adapt to modern technology and societal changes. However the truth is that many older adults are open to learning and adapting, whether it’s embracing new technologies, participating in social movements, or trying new experiences.
* Older adults continuing to experience love, romance, and sexual desire goes against the stereotype of elderly people being asexual, lacking in romantic interest or relationships. Many maintain active romantic lives and seek out meaningful relationships.
* The common trope of the “grumpy old man” or “cynical old woman” may not reflect the reality where older individuals exhibit a wide range of emotions and attitudes, with many displaying optimism, wisdom, humour, and a positive outlook on life.
* There’s a narrative that elderly individuals are a burden on society, requiring extensive care and resources without contributing back. The reality is that older adults contribute significantly to society through volunteer work, mentorship, caregiving, and sharing their skills and knowledge.

Aging is just one aspect of a person’s identity, and older individuals have diverse experiences, interests, and abilities that extend far beyond their age. Defining any person solely on age leads to agism, which is discrimination based on age. Challenging these stereotypes is essential for fostering a more inclusive society where the elderly are valued for their contributions and experiences.


**_Implementing Aims_**

To implement these aims, a short narrative fiction film will be developed with the aid of members of the community who are over sixty-five. A fictional film provides the ideal vehicle for participants and audiences to reflect on their role within their community. Because this project is about breaking stereotypes of the elderly in our community, people over the age of sixty-five will be asked to contribute their opinions on a diverge range of issues effecting them. The film story will come from older locals and be developed in a way to emphasise their concerns, the challenges they face and to highlight forms of discrimination that occur due to age. It is seen as crucial that the stories told don’t preach to a particular audience but rather explore different sides of an issue and allow ambiguities to exist. The project is not about demonising anyone but rather showing how unthoughtful actions potentially affect people in a negative way.

Breaking Stereotypes will be made possible due to volunteer involvement. Without local’s contribution of their time, a project such as this is not possible. Because this project is **co-op**, everyone volunteering has joint ownership of the completed film. I hope the true value of participating is the shared experience of creating this film. There will be opportunities for volunteers to express themselves creatively and have new kinds of experiences.

## OUTCOMES

The outcome of this project will be a fictional narrative short film.

Even though I want the participants to reflect on their experiences, it is important that any ideas or examples are distilled to create a potent experience for viewers. The **fictional** aspect of this project allows a story to be constructed which is based on many accounts or events. The development of the story will be done in a way to promote understanding from all parties by leaving ambiguity to reflect the reality of situations and life. Fiction allows the deepening and distillation of real life examples to create a stronger meaning for a viewer. 

**Narrative** relates to showing rather than telling the audience. I don’t want issues to be preached. Leaving space for viewers to interpret the actions onscreen allows for them to reflect on the relevant issues.

The aim to produce a **short** film is a realistic goal and is a focus on quality over quantity. I want the group to create an experience which is meaningful and relevant for the audience. Financially, shooting a short project which fits into a two or three day production schedule, is achievable without sacrificing quality. The film’s duration will be between 10 to 30 minutes

**Film** is a wonderful medium for sharing. As well as dramatically engaging with an audience, it is an effective way to communicate to a broad variety of people. It can be screened for a particular audience, or posted on a sharing video platform, such as Vimeo or YouTube. The aim is to create something which can potentially reach a large audience. There is the possibility of submitting to film festivals around Australia as well as other opportunity for community screenings.

## TIMELINE

There are three main phases to the project: finding a story, the film’s production and post-production. Because of the first two phases, there is an opportunity for people to only meet and discuss potential ideas and story, while other individuals may be interested in actively being involved in the film’s production. Everyone participating will be encouraged to try new tasks and express themselves in how they feel comfortable. The project is slated for nine months production timeline. This schedule allows for possible challenges and unexpected situations to be resolved conformably.


**_Phase One: Finding stories (2 months)_**

‘Finding a story’ is a process of developing a narrative film story. The potential audience for the film should appeal to all ages even though it focuses on the elderly. This will primarily be due to communicating a human story which dissolves boundaries between different age groups. This process is not about promoting any specific opinions within predefined age groups, but rather show through the onscreen drama how people are affected by actions. It is important not to preach, but asking questions, which don’t necessarily have an easy answers but portray significant issues.

Fiction allows the creation of strong meaning from real life examples. The process of developing a fictional account is about strengthening moments in the narrative and creating an overall effect which is worthy of the audience’s time.

This first phase has two parts:
* Opening up: I will be guiding the sessions by prompting participants with questions about stereotypes and aging. 
* Distilling down: Once we have collected enough story material for our film, a process of distilling the story to a tight narrative.


**_Phase Two: Rehearsal and production (2 months)_**

The second phase involves the production of the film. During the production phase, the cast will likely include senior citizens as well as younger people based on the story created. A pre-production period includes rehearsals, where participants will be required to improvise. Also organisation of locations, hiring of crew and catering need to be completed before shooting.

Production will take place over a two to three day shooting period which will be carefully organised.


**_Phase Three: Post-production (5 months)_**

Post-production involves the editing, sound mixing and colour grading of the short film. Depending on how far I can stretch the budget, will dictate if I outsource the sound mixing and colour grading.

## EXAMPLES OF VIDEO WORK

I have included three videos to illustrate work that I have produced in the past. Though they explore different themes and genres, the videos indicate the qualities of the short being produced. 

*Doreen’s Dead* (2023) is a black comedy and was recently shot on a small budget on Tamborine Mountain.

## CONCLUSION

This project seeks to help create a society where elderly individuals are recognised and valued for their contributions, abilities, and diverse experiences. By telling stories which challenge negative preconceptions of aging, we all profit from appreciating what elderly Australian have to offer.
